^ Before we dig in, I will introduce myself very quickly:

Bonjour ! üëã

My name is Guillaume Bogard. I'm a Scala Developer @Linkvalue.

I love functional programming, roller-coasters, and Age of Empires.

You can follow me on Twitter @bogardguillaume and on guillaumebogard.dev

## Agenda

1. Effects and the substitution model of evaluation
2. Free monads, interpreters, and their benefits
3. Implementing Free monads in Scala and Haskell
4. Free monads *in the real world*

---

^ Alright, let met start this talk with a question:

## What is functional programming about?

^ I'm sure some of you, if not most, already know what functional programming is: programming with mathematical functions, also referred to as "pure functions". 
And I'm guessing that some of you are already convinced of their benefits: more stability, more productivity, lower maintenance costs ...
But why do pure functions matter ? What is it that makes the functional programmer often more productive, and functional programs more stable than let's say imperative programs?

---

## What is the *root benefit* of functional programming?

^ I'm interested in answering this question because it will motivate the use of free monads later on.
For the purpose of this talk I am going to assert that all the benefits of functional programming ‚Äì the productivity increase, the enhanced stability of programs, and their comparatively
low maintenance cost, all come from one root benefit, one fundamental aspect of functional programming.

---

### Functional programming is expression-oriented.
## Evaluating a program is just evaluating expressions recursively until there are no more sub-expressions

^ This is what we refer to as the substitution model of evaluation. This way of evaluating programs is common across all
functional programming languages, statically typed and otherwise.

---

## Expressions are equivalent if they have the same normal form\*

^ The supoer power of a functional programmer is the ability to use substitution as their reasoning paradigm.
Substitution is easier to grasp than *time*, a fundamental variable in imperative programming

#### But there's a catch, more on that in a minute

---

## How substitution works

Large expressions are computed by evaluating every sub-expression

[.code-highlight: 1-3]
[.code-highlight: 1, 4]
[.code-highlight: 1, 5]
[.code-highlight: 1, 6]
[.code-highlight: 1, 7]
[.code-highlight: 1, 8]
[.code-highlight: 1, 9]

```haskell
plusOne a = a + 1

x = plusOne $ plusOne $ plusOne 16
x = plusOne $ plusOne 16 + 1 
x = plusOne $ plusOne 17
x = plusOne 17 + 1
x = plusOne 18
x = 18 + 1
x = 19
```

---

## How substitution works

At any point, I can substitute an expression with its normal form without changing the program.

```haskell
x = plusOne $ plusOne $ plusOne 16
```

is equivalent to

```haskell
x = plusOne $ 18
```

---

## How substitution works

Expressions can be moved around freely without changing the program. In other words, the order of evaluation is irrelevant.

```haskell
a = Musician "John"
b = Musician "Paul"
c = Musician "Ringo"
d = Musician "George"

song = play [a, b, c, d]
```

## Why substitution matters

### The ability to build programs out of freely-manipulable expressions is at the :heart: of what makes FP so appealing

---

- **Dramatically reduced cognitive load**
  Order of execution is irrelevant. Expressions can be reasoned about in complete isolation. 
  The meaning of a program is mostly inferable from signatures alone.
  
^ This one is what makes FP most appealing to me. Programming is hard, but it doesn't have to be *that hard*. As programs grow in complexity, being able to reason about them without constant headaches is a massive improvement.
  
- **Easy unit tests**
  *I give you this, you should give me that*
  
^ I think its well-established now that unit testing pure functions is the easiest form of testing there is.

- **Unmatched adaptability**
  What we call *refactoring* is manipulating expressions without altering the program.
  
---

Sprinkle some performance boosts on of that:

- **Easy concurrency**
  Remember, Time isn't a thing anymore
  
  
- **Programs could be inspected and optimized ahead of evaluation**
  After all, programs are *just data* right ?

<br />

In short, substitution is at the :heart: of everything we love about FP

---

### But, remember, there's a catch

---

## Expressions are equivalent if they have the same normal form\*
### \*Assuming the program is *referentially transparent*

---

## When substitution breaks

We you start putting *side-effects* everywhere, you lose the ability to manipulate expressions freely

```scala
def greet(name: String): String = { blastAlderaan(); s"Hello $name!" }
val x = greet("Mike")
```

isn't remotely the same as

```scala
val x = "Hello Mike!"
```

Signatures, like `greet(name: String): String`, become useless.

---

## Common practices that break substitution

- Using the standard input / output
- Throwing exceptions
- Performing network calls
- Relying on shared mutable state
- Reading and writing to files

And so much more.

^ Here comes the million-dollar question

---

## How do build *anything* useful without breaking substitution ?

---

^ The answer to that question lies in a process called *reification*. The idea is that instead of ordering the
computer to do stuff, we will pure data structures that describe the intended behavior. We will wait the very last moment
to *interpret* these structures into actions at runtime.

## Turning *actions* into *effects*

Turning imperative side-effects into mere *descriptions*, and deferring their execution until the *end of the world*, allows us to freely substitute these descriptions.

We use pure data structures to describe the intended behavior, without running any externally visible effect until we have to.
 
The type system will help track the nature of the effects, in addition to the type of values our programs produce.

---

# *It's just data!*‚Ñ¢
### ‚Äì every Clojure developer ever

---

### Example: replacing Exceptions with Either

Instead of altering the control flow of the program, we use a type to encode the *possibility of a failure*. 
Substitution still holds.

[.column]

```scala
def getSecretContent(user: User) = 
  if(user.role === "admin") Right(42) 
  else Left(Forbidden)

val result = getSecretContent(
  User("emma", role = "customer")
)
```

[.column]


```scala
val result = Left(Forbidden)
```

---

### Example: replacing Exceptions with Either

Assumptions are easily verified

```scala
getSecretContent(User("emma", role = "customer")) shouldBe Left(Forbidden)
```

---

## Why effects matter

When *side-effects* are turned into declarative structures tracked by the type system, we don't call them side-effect
anymore, but *effects*.

**Effects matter because they enable solutions to every computing problem, while satisfying the substitution principle**

---

## Turning arbitrary instructions into effects

^ `Option` can encode emptiness, and `Either` can encode failure. There are other common effects as well. But often we need something more flexible.

The `IO` monad can turn any set of instructions into a referentially-transparent value.
Substitution holds until the `IO` is ran, which usually happens *at the end of the world*.

[.column]

```scala
def greetUser(name: String) = IO {
  println(s"Hello $name!")
}

def run = greetUser("Hans") >> exit
```

[.column]

```scala
def run = IO {
  println(s"Hello Hans!")
} >> exit
```

^ In a sense, IO allows us to embed imperative programs in a declarative context. IO captures side-effects and turns
them values that can be freely passed around. The effect description is separated from the execution, which only happens
when we explicitly call the `unsafeRunSync` method. The type system tells us not only about the type of value the program will produce,
but also about the presence of arbitrary side-effects.

---

## Why IO isn't always ideal

Remember why we care about substitution in the first place.

- :white_check_mark: Can we safely move expressions around and exchange them for their normal forms? Absolutely.
- ü§∑‚Äç Does the type system tell us about the nature of our program's effects? Kind of
- :x: Can we inspect our program and optimize it before it is evaluated? Not really
- :x: Is it easy to unit-test our program? Nope

---

## Can we do better ?

---

### Well, it would be a disappointing talk if we couldn't, right?

# II
# Free monads and their interpreters

---

## What is a Free monad?

A *Free monad* is a structure of type `Free f a` that gives you a monad for any functor `f`.

In short, it can turn any functor into a monad.

---

## How is it useful ?

A free monad allows building programs using the terms of a *domain-specific language (DSL)*.

Said programs are pure, freely-inspectable data structures that don't produce anything. 
They are meant to be *interpreted* into another monad that will actually produce the values we want.

---

## How is it useful ?

`Free` enables us to decouple the description of any program from its actual evaluation.
The type system will tell us about the specific DSL in which the program is defined.

:bulb: As a bonus, we can change interpreters without affecting our business logic, making `Free` a suitable alternative to the *tagless final encoding*.

---

## How `Free` works

1. Define a DSL `F` that will describe the capabilities of our program
2. Define *smart constructors* that will lift terms of the DSL into the `Free` context
3. Build a program using these constructors and `>>=`
You can inspect and test your program without performing any effect
4. Interpret your program into another monad (usually IO) using a natural transformation from `F` to `IO`

---

## A Free monad for subscriptions management

##### Haskell samples use the `free` package, Scala samples use Cats

---

We start by defining our DSL

[.column]

```scala
sealed trait UserStoreDsl[T]

case class GetUser(id: UserId) 
  extends UserStoreDsl[User]

case class GetSubscription(userId: UserId)
  extends UserStoreDsl[Option[Subscription]]

case class DeleteSubscription(id: SubId)
  extends UserStoreDsl[Unit]

case class Subscribe(user: User) 
  extends UserStoreDsl[Subscription]
```

[.column]

```haskell
data UserStoreDsl next
  = GetUser UserId (User -> next)
  | GetSubscription 
      UserId 
      (Maybe Subscription -> next)
  | DeleteSubscription SubId next
  | Subscribe User (Subscription -> next)
  deriving (Functor)

type UserStore = Free UserStoreDsl
```

---

Then the smart constructors


[.column]

```scala
def getUser(id: UserId): UserStore[User] = 
  Free.liftF(GetUser(id))

def getSubscription(id: UserId)
  : UserStore[Option[Subscription]] =
  Free.liftF(GetSubscription(id))

def deleteSubscription(id: SubId)
  : UserStore[Unit] =
  Free.liftF(DeleteSubscription(id))

def subscribe(user: User)
  : UserStore[Subscription] =
  Free.liftF(Subscribe(user))
```

[.column]

```haskell
getUser :: UserId -> UserStore User
getUser uid = liftF (GetUser uid id)

getSubscription ::
  UserId -> UserStore (Maybe Subscription)
getSubscription uid = 
  liftF (GetSubscription uid id)

deleteSubscription :: SubId -> UserStore ()
deleteSubscription subId = 
  liftF (DeleteSubscription subId ())

subscribe :: User -> UserStore Subscription
subscribe u = liftF (Subscribe u id)
```

---

Then we use our DSL to build a program

[.column]

```scala
def updateSubscription(userId: UserId)
  : UserStore[Unit] =
  for {
    user <- getUser(userId)
    oldSub <- getSubscription(userId)
    _ <- oldSub match {
      case Some(sub) => 
        deleteSubscription(sub.id)
      case None      =>
        ().pure[UserStore]
    }
    _ <- subscribe(user)
  } yield ()
```
[.column]

```haskell
updateSubscription 
  :: UserId -> UserStore ()

updateSubscription userId = do
  user <- getUser userId
  oldSub <- getSubscription userId
  case oldSub of
    Just (Subscription id) -> 
      deleteSubscription id
    Nothing -> pure ()
  subscribe user
  return ()
```

---

We then define an interpreter for our DSL

[.column]

```scala
val userStoreCompiler
  : UserStoreDsl ~> IO = {

  case GetUser(id) =>
    // Fetch user from database
    User(id).pure[IO]

  case GetSubscription(UserId("123")) =>
    Subscription(SubId("1")).some.pure[IO]

  case GetSubscription(_) => 
    Option.empty.pure[IO]

  case DeleteSubscription(_) => IO.unit

  case Subscribe(_) =>
    Subscription(SubId("new-sub")).pure[IO]
}
```

[.column]

```haskell
type f ~> g = forall x. f x -> g x

userStoreInterpreter :: UserStoreDsl ~> IO
userStoreInterpreter (GetUser id next) = do
  -- Fetch user from database
  let user = User (UserId "123")
  pure (next user)

userStoreInterpreter 
  (GetSubscription (UserId "123") next) = do
    let sub = Subscription (SubId "1")
    pure (next (Just sub))

userStoreInterpreter (GetSubscription _ next) =
  pure (next Nothing)

userStoreInterpreter (DeleteSubscription _ next) =
  pure next

userStoreInterpreter (Subscribe _ next) = do
  let sub = Subscription (SubId "new-sub")
  pure (next sub)
```

---

Finally, we can interpret our program *into the IO monad*. 
We've built a PL inside our PL!

^ Expressing our solutions using the terms of a DSL gives us the ability to test then without executing any
externally-visible effect. Following the tenet of *don't test the framework*, we test only the program itself, and trust the interpreter
to do its job properly. Of course, the interpreter can, and probably must, also be tested seperately

# Implementing Free monads

---

# IV
# Free monads in the real world

---

### *Real-world practice* #1: mocking

[.column]

Free monads allow mocking parts of our program selectively. Mocking is as easy as writing an interpreter.

[.column]

```scala
// Todo: write the example

```

---


### *Real-world practice* #2: swapping interpreters


[.column]

The same program can be interpreted using different interpreters, e.g. to provide various storage backends for a data-access layer.

[.column]

```scala
// Todo: write the example

```

---

### *Real-world practice* #3: monadic interface for your library

[.column]

Monads reduce the needed amount of documentation and give many operations for free.

*Doobie* uses free monads to database transactions on which users can use for-comprehensions, `>>`, `<<`, `as` etc.

[.column]

```scala
// Todo: write the example

```

---

### *Real-word practice* #4: combining DSLs

#### Every program can spefically select the operations they need, instead of having access to every possible operation.
